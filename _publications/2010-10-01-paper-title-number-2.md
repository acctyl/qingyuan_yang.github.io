abstract: This study examines the demand and interest rate spread of green multifamily mortgages purchased by Fannie Mae through four potential channels: a salience channel triggered by natural disasters, a bank sustainability commitment channel, a selection channel involving properties in poor condition, and a compliance channel related to local legislation. The research finds that properties financed through green mortgages, designed to enhance energy efficiency in multifamily housing, not only benefit from lower loan premiums but also outperform their non-green counterparts. While green mortgages exhibit higher Loan-to-Value ratios, suggesting increased risk, the differences in prepayment rates and delinquency are negligible. Additionally, this paper analyzes the actual environmental impact of Fannie Mae’s green bond initiative.
