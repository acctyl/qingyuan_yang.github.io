excerpt: 'This paper is about the number 3. The number 4 is left for future work.'
abstract: We study the effects of bank lending on firms’ green transition in Chinese public firms. The empirical setting exploits the regulations on banks’ green credit performance in 2016 as a positive shock to banks’ sustainability commitments. Using a triple difference-in-differences framework, we document that only in the smallfirm subsample, brown firms whose relationship banks are the more committed banks borrow significantly fewer short-term loans than green firms, compared to firms with other relationship banks. We also find that only in the small-firm subsample, brown firms whose relationship banks are the more committed banks make significantly more efforts in green transition than other brown firms. There is no significant result in the large-firm subsample. This heterogeneity is consistent with the higher financing frictions of small firms. Higher friction leads small firms to be more sensitive to the sustainability commitments of their relationship banks than large firms.
